<p>Conjoint analysis is based on showing multiple combinations, at random, each time varying some parameters.</p>
<p>For example, in our study we have shown different options to receive a class action lawsuit compensation on the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the compensation given by push or pull (do you have to actively ask for it in order to get it).</li>
<li>Is the compensation given by credit cart/bank cheque/coupon/refund at next purchase/complementary product.</li>
<li>What is the compensation amount (at four levels: 25 ILS, 50 ILS, 75 ILS, 100 ILS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each respondent received five randomized sets (each set with three packages to choose the best one).</p>
<p>For example, he might have been requested to choose the best option out of the following three:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be given a compensation of 25 ILS, to your credit card, and you don't have to ask for it; or</li>
<li>You will be given a compensation of 50 ILS, as a coupon, but you have to ask for it in order to get it; or</li>
<li>You will be given a compensation of 100 ILS, as a complementary product that the company will choose for you, and you have to ask for it in order to get it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The data was then analyzed using logistic regression to determine the relative influence of each parameter on the attractiveness of the package.</p>
