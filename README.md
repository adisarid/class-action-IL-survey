# Class actions in Israel

Survey results about class actions in Israel. The data was collected by [Sarid Research Institute LTD.](https://www.sarid-ins.com), with collaboration from ADV. Asaf Pink, and the know-it center for legal qualifications [http://knowit.org.il/](http://knowit.org.il/).

The purpose of collecting and analyzing this data was originally intended to present it at the 9th class action conference in Israel. 

This data is made publicly accessible, in an anonymized version.

## Data files

There was an effort to translate as much material as possible to English, however, the data was collected in Hebrew, and open-ended questions (including "other, specify:__" questions), have remained in Hebrew.

The data is split to two data files - one survey whih was directed to general public and another survey which was directed to laywers in Israel which filed a class action suit in the last 5 years.

We have also added an R Markdown analysis file which we used as basis for our presentation (which is also available under sub-dir presentation).

The results are also published, in Hebrew, in the following websites:

   * Sarid Institute's website [https://www.sarid-ins.co.il](https://www.sarid-ins.co.il)
   * Know-it's website [http://knowit.org.il](http://knowit.org.il)
